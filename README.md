# 📘 100 Days of Solidity  

Welcome to my **100 Days of Solidity** journey 🚀  
This repository tracks my daily progress in learning **Solidity, Smart Contracts, and Web3 development**.  

---

## 🗓 Daily Progress  

### ✅ Day 1: Storage Contract  
- Learned basics of Solidity.  
- Built a simple contract to store & retrieve a number.  

### ✅ Day 2: Wallet & Testnets  
- Set up MetaMask.  
- Explored Sepolia and Celo testnets.  

### ✅ Day 3: First Deployment  
- Deployed first contract on Remix.  

### ✅ Day 4: Data Structures  
- Practiced `arrays`, `mappings`, and `structs`.  
- Built `PeopleRegistry.sol`.  

### ✅ Day 5: Functions & Visibility  
- Explored function types (`public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`).  
- Used modifiers like `onlyOwner`.  
- Created `BalanceManager.sol`.  

### ✅ Day 6: Logic & Loops  
- Practiced `if/else` statements.  
- Wrote `EvenOddChecker.sol` to check numbers.  
- Built `sumArray` to loop through numbers.  
- Extended `PeopleRegistry` with `countAdults()` using loops.  

### ✅ Day 7: Function Visibility & Modifiers  
- Reinforced function visibility: `public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`.  
- Wrote `visibilityFunctions.sol` to test them.  
- Added modifiers (`onlyOwner`) in `accessCheck.sol`.  

### ✅ Day 8: Documentation & Bank Project  
- Learned the importance of clear documentation.  
- Created `BankProject.sol` with:  
  - Deposit & Withdraw functions.  
  - User balances tracking.  
  - `onlyOwner` check for total contract balance.  
  - Events for logging.  
- Updated `README.md` to reflect progress.  
- Organized repo for clarity.
