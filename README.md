This repository documents my journey of learning **Solidity and Web3 development** step by step over 100 days.  
Each day I write, test, and push smart contracts to this repo, building towards a complete dApp portfolio project.  

---

## 🌟 Goals of This Journey
- Master Solidity basics (data types, functions, arrays, mappings, structs, enums).  
- Understand Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains (Celo, Sepolia, etc).  
- Build and deploy smart contracts using Remix, MetaMask, and testnets.  
- Gradually work on a **progressive project** that grows more complex each week.  
- Create a public proof-of-work portfolio on GitHub.

## 📆 Daily Progress 
### ✅ Day 1: Storage
- Wrote my first smart contract (`Storage.sol`) to save and retrieve a number.

### ✅ Day 2: Wallet Setup
- Installed MetaMask, connected to Sepolia & Celo testnets.
- Documented setup steps in `Day2_WalletSetup.md`.

### ✅ Day 3: First Deployment
- Used Remix to deploy my first contract.
- Learned how to interact with functions on-chain.

### ✅ Day 4: Data Structures
- Built a People Registry contract.
- Learned about arrays, structs, mappings, state/local variables.

### ✅ Day 5: Functions
- Built Balance Manager contract.
- Practiced function types (`view`, `pure`, `payable`) and visibility.


### ✅ Day 1–3: Setup & Basics
- Installed MetaMask & configured test networks.  
- Learned how blockchain stores and executes transactions.  
- Wrote my first “Storage” smart contract in Remix.  

### ✅ Day 4: Data Structures
- Learned about **state vs local variables**.  
- Worked with **arrays, mappings, and structs**.  
- Built a **People Registry contract**.  
- Practiced adding and retrieving records by index & address.  

### ✅ Day 5: Functions
- Explored **function types**: `view`, `pure`, `payable`.  
- Understood **function visibility**: `public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`.  
- Built a **Balance Manager contract** with update & read functions.
